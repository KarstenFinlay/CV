## [Profile](#Profile):

Graduate of Makers, junior full stack developer and enthusiastic learner. Constantly learning and applying my skills to new projects. 

Ever since the start of my journey at Makers Academy I have worked very well in a groups, usually taking a more manage like role, my use of agile tools and skills made it easy to work in large groups, I usually get to the point while taking others into consideration. Communication is a valued skill I possess, key to having a flexable and solid team dynamic.

Avid video game player and game designer. I have created multiple video games in gam jams or just for fun. I want to keep improving so that I can apply what I learn to improve the overall quality of the games I make.

### Resilience

I am often able to bounce back when in a tough situation. When doing Gold DofE we were told to go to the wrong campsite. The site was flooded and there was no where to set up. So, I decided to carry people's bags to a barn, we decided to rest there instead. 

### Inventive

Thinking up interesting game mechanics and design is my speciality. Often at Astral Dawn Studios LTD, I was coming up with ideas of how to make the game stand out from the crowd. We ran a discord server in which we recieved feedback from the public. One of which talked about the game being too slow. So to change this I altered how much air resistance affected the dodo, and changed the level to feel more fast paced. After that the same user said that the game was much faster.

### Leadership

In many of the game jams I attended, I was often put as the leader as I reached out to people to form groups. I usually help with every area checking up on how everyone was doing. When I was working at the Bristol Global Game Jam 2020, our group didn't really know what to do. So I decided that I would step in and start asking people what they want to do, what their skills were and what game we were aiming for. From there I made sure that people were taking breaks and most importantly still enjoying their work.
