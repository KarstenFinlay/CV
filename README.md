## [Profile](#Profile):

Graduate of Makers, junior full stack developer and enthusiastic learner. Constantly learning and applying my skills to new projects.

Ever since the start of my journey at Makers Academy I have worked very well in groups, usually taking a more managerial like role. My use of agile tools and skills made it easy to work in large groups. I am a good communicator while also being flexible so that I can generate a solid team dynamic.

Avid video game player and game designer. I have created multiple video games in game jams and just for fun.

### Resilience

One of my strengths is that I can bounce back from situations of adversity and stress. This attribute has had a profound effect on my personal growth and has helped me to learn from difficult situations.

### Inventive

While studying at Makers and attending the Bristol Global Game Jam 2020, I realised that I am an inventive person. In both situations I was able to come up with good ideas or suitable solutions to problems that were encountered. Whether in regard to creativity or problem-solving I have been able to find inventive and efficient ways forward.

### Leadership

While studying at Makers and attending the Bristol Global Game Jam 2020, I realised that I am an inventive person. In both situations I was able to come up with good ideas or suitable solutions to problems that were encountered. Whether in regard to creativity or problem-solving I have been able to find inventive and efficient ways forward.

### Teamwork

Working in groups is a strength of mine. In the most recent project, Spring Onion, a part of the team were having difficulties with a git merge - there were too many conflicting files – so we had a call where I explained how to fix the problem, enabling them to proceed and not lose time. Outside of official group work, I had three mentees to guide and I often answered queries posted to our Slack channel.

#### Other

I have completed the Duke of Edinburgh Gold award. In terms of language, I am an intermediate German user and a Japanese language beginner.

## Work experience:

Waiter at St George's House Trust, Windsor, Windsor Castle (Sep 2019 - May 2020)

My experience as a waiter in St George’s House Conference Centre within Windsor Castle enabled me to strengthen my communication and team-building skills. This job also gave me an opportunity to work with people from diverse members of society. This position required careful listening and a willingness to work hard behind the scenes.

Designer/Developer at Astral Dawn Studios LTD (May 2020 - Sep 2020)

While working as a designer at Astral Dawn Studios I developed a passion for coding. While there I designed characters, levels and mechanics for Dodo Alone, a 2D pixel platformer. I got to grips with agile processes, sprints, stand ups and retros. Github was used throughout the whole process, so I got used to version control, difficult merges and rebases. Clear communication via good commits was essential. I now also understand the work flow in the tech industry.
